  I successfully completed this without assistance from the video barring the wikipedia challenge and the last reduce challenge. I didn't realize the wikipedia challenge would be done in the Dev Tools on the Wikipedia page itself-- I thought somehow the data could be drawn as an API. Once I let go of that idea this challenge made more sense. The final challenge where you accumulate the number of times an index repeats was difficult too-- I'm still learning the functionality and boundaries of the reduce() method.
